We must understand terms:

1. Information Security[ InfoSec ]:
````````````````````````
-> What is Information: [Differ b/w Info & Data]
> Meaningful form of data
> Can be called as processed data
> Data has no context, info does
eg:
> Computer is data
> This is my computer is information






NOTE: Information in digital systems makes cyber security [Information involving cyber space].

2. Information Security Threats:
--------------------------------
> Threat is a constant danger to an asset
> It can be a person, object or an event
> Threat can be categorized and ranked
















































Type of Threats :

1. Inadvertent Threat	[ Human Failure ]
2. Physical Threat 	[ Natural disasters ]
3. Technical Failure	[ Hardware / Software ]
4. Deliberate acts	[ Hacking / Espionage ]

3. Introduction to Cyber Security:
----------------------------------
> Information Security does not deal with?

	- Cyber Warfare		[Govt Web Hacks, DDOS, etc.]
	- Information Warfare	[Intel]
	- Negative Impact of people on Internet ( sexual abuse, cyber stalking, etc. )
	- IoT Security

Then who deal with them?









































































> Cyber Security:
	- Protection of Cyber Space against Cyber Threats and Cyber Space vulnerabilities.
	- Any threats to Information via Cyber Space
	- Deal with Deliberate acts
	- Doesn't deal with physical and personal security
	- Threats via Cyber Space, not threats for Cyber Space.






> Objective of Cyber Security:
	- Confidentiality	: No telling to unauthorized parties
	- Integrity		: Completeness and accuracy of data
	- Availability		: When needed, data is available
	- Non-repudiation	: I should accept i sent you the message and you should accept you received it.
	- Authenticity		: You should actually be who you tell you are

The CIA Triad:
--------------
Triangle of InfoSec: 
	1. CONFIDENTIALITY
	2. INTEGRITY
	3. AVAILABILITY
 
CONFIDENTIALITY:
----------------
- Roughly but wider than privacy
- Sensitive Data should not reach wrong people
- Sensitive Data should reach right people
~ Measures: 
	^ Data encryption
	^ Authentication ( maybe MFA/2FA )
	^ More sensitive, more physical

INTEGRITY:
----------
- Data should be consistent, trustworthy and accurate
- Data must not change in transit
- More complex to implement
~ Measures:
	^ Backups
	^ Cryptographic measures (checksums)
	^ Access Control

AVAILABILITY:
-------------
- Data should be available as and when needed
- Updated softwares and hardwares
- Adequate system capacity and bandwidth
~ Measures:
	^ Firewall rules/policies
	^ Patch management and disaster recovery
	^ Load balancers [ CDNs, Cloudflare, AkamaiGhost ....nginx ]

What is Hacking?
----------------
- There are no standard definition of hacking
- Media continues to add false information about hacking
- There are good hackers, and there are bad

Information Warfare:
--------------------
- "Tactical and strategic use of information, to gain advantage."
- In earlier days, information was more physical, Groups of people involved, especially   Government, to tackle enimies.
- Country spend millions in secret intelligence and spies
- Military used weapons and army power to send policy implementations

Terminologies:
--------------
- Vulnerability		: A weakness that can be exploited
- Threat		: One who exploits a vuln
- Risk			: Damage caused by exploiting vuln
- Asset			: Which needs to be accessed after exploitation
- Bug			: Error, fault or flaw in a computer program that may cause unexpected behaviour

What is Penetration Testing:
````````````````````````````
[Penetration Testing, Ethical Hacking, Security Audit] is a process to find [Vulnerability, loophole, weakness] in a [system, network, application etc]
